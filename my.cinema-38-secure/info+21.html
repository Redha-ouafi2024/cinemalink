Colin Firth
  </p>

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">
  Colin Andrew Firth (born September 10, 1960) is an English actor and producer. He was identified in the mid-1980s with the "Brit Pack" of rising young British actors, undertaking a challenging series of roles, including leading roles in A Month in the Country (1987), Tumbledown (1988) and Valmont (1989). His portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 1995 television adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice led to widespread attention, and to roles in more prominent films such as The English Patient (1996), Shakespeare in Love (1998), Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), The Importance of Being Earnest (2002), Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), Richard Curtis's romantic comedy ensemble film Love Actually (2003), and the musical comedy Mamma Mia! (2008) and its sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! (2018).

In 2009, Firth received international acclaim for his performance in Tom Ford's A Single Man, for which he won a BAFTA Award and received his first Academy Award nomination. In 2010, his portrayal of King George VI in Tom Hooper's The King's Speech won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. He subsequently appeared as MI6 agent Bill Haydon in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), and as secret agent Harry Hart in Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) and its sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017). He has since appeared in the musical fantasy Mary Poppins Returns (2018), and Sam Mendes' war film 1917 (2019), and Supernova (2020). He is also known for his performances in television including the BBC film Conspiracy (2001), and HBO's The Staircase (2022), receiving Primetime Emmy Award nominations for each.

In 2012, he founded the production company Raindog Films, where he served as a producer for Eye in the Sky (2015) and Loving (2016). His films have grossed more than $3 billion from 42 releases worldwide. Firth has campaigned for the rights of indigenous tribal people and is a member of Survival International. He has campaigned on issues of asylum seekers, refugees' rights and the environment. He commissioned and co-authored a scientific paper on a study of the differences in brain structure between people of differing political orientations.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2011, Firth was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for his services to drama. That same year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and appeared in Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.

Matthew Allard de Vere Drummond
(born Matthew Allard Robert Vaughn; 7 March 1971),
 known professionally as Matthew Vaughn, 
 is an English filmmaker.He has produced films including Lock,
  Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000),
   and directed Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007),
    Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011), 
	and Argylle (2024). Vaughn also co-created 
	the Kingsman comic book series and resulting 
	franchise, directing, producing and co-writing
	 the films Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014),
	  Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017), and The King's Man (2021).

Early life
Vaughn was born in Paddington,
 London, England.Until 2002,
  he had thought that he was 
  the child of a relationship
   between his mother, Kathy
    Ceaton (died 20 July 2013),
	 and American actor Robert Vaughn.A paternity investigation 
	 in the 1980s revealed that Robert Vaughn was
	  not his father, but Ceaton had never revealed
	   otherwise to Vaughn. Upon asking his mother
	   about his true paternity, she revealed that 
	   his father was George Albert Harley 
	   de Vere Drummond,an English banker. 
	   Early in Vaughn's life, before
	   the paternity investigation,
	    Robert Vaughn had asked for
		the child's surname to be Vaughn, 
		and it continues 
		today as Vaughn's professional name,
		 though he now uses de Vere Drummond
		  in his personal life,[4] having changed it by deed poll in May 2002.

Vaughn was educated at 
Sussex House School in London 
and then Stowe School in Buckingham.
 Taking a gap year between Stowe and university,
  he travelled around the world on a Hard Rock Cafe tour.
   After arriving in Los Angeles he began working as an
    assistant to a film director. He later returned to 
	London, and attended University College London studying
	 anthropology and ancient history. He dropped out after a few weeks.
