An actor, comedian and writer, Seth Rogen has come a long way from doing stand-up comedy as a teen.

Rogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Sandy (Belogus), a social worker, and Mark Rogen, who worked for non-profits. His father is American-born and his mother is Canadian. He is of Russian Jewish descent. He attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School (although he dropped out of high school to move to Los Angeles) and was known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp. At sixteen, Rogen placed second in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest.

Soon after that he landed his first role in Judd Apatow's short-lived but well regarded TV series Freaks and Geeks (1999), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, James Franco, and Jason Segel. This early work sharpened Rogen's keen improvisational skills, which he's used on many projects since.

Following Freaks and Geeks (1999), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of Da Ali G Show (2000) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner Evan Goldberg. The writing team received an Emmy nomination. As a huge fan of the first season, Rogen was thrilled to get the chance to work with Sacha Baron Cohen.

Continuing his work with Apatow, he joined the cast of Apatow's debut film The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) and is credited as co-producer. After that he took the lead in Knocked Up (2007), Apatow's second movie and a huge success. He's since been a frequent collaborator with Apatow, in projects such as Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and Funny People (2009). He co-wrote Superbad (2007), with Goldberg; the pair started the project when they were teens. They won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Writing in a Film in 2008.

Christoph Waltz
  </p>

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">
 
Christoph Waltz is an Austrian-German actor. He is known for his work with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenf眉hrer Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa.

Christoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, into a theatrical family, his mother Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. His maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book "Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness".

Waltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.

During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theatre, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly Waltz began to work in TV, taking one-off roles in series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed. Attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were, however, unsuccessful. Waltz has expressed his gratitude to have been able to make a living and support his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.

It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) catapulted Waltz from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Unchained (2012)).

He also has portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film The Zero Theorem (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenf眉hrer Hans Landa, aka "The Jew Hunter". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in The Green Hornet (2011). That same year, he starred in Water for Elephants (2011), Roman Polanski's Carnage (2011), and a remake of The Three Musketeers (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.

Waltz resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">

Cameron Diaz, an American actress, was born in 1972 in San Diego, the daughter of a Cuban-American father and a German mother. Self described as "adventurous, independent and a tough kid,
Cameron left home at 16 and for the next 5 years lived in such varied locales as Japan, Australia,
 Mexico, Morocco, and Paris. 
 Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when she auditioned for a
  big part in The Mask (1994). To her amazement and despite having no previous acting experience,
   she was cast as the female lead in the film opposite Jim Carrey. Over the next 3 years,
    she honed her acting skills in such low budget independent films as The Last Supper (1995);
    Feeling Minnesota (1996); and Head Above Water (1996). She returned to main stream films in
     My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), in which she held her own against veteran actress Julia Roberts.
      She earned full fledged star status in 1998 for her performance in the box office smash There's
       Something About Mary (1998). Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become
        one of the super stars of the new century.

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">

Popular British character actor Tom Wilkinson was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, and came from a long line of urban farmers. He was the son of Marjorie (Percival) and Thomas Wilkinson. Economic hardships forced his family to move to Canada for a few years when Wilkinson was a child; then, after he had returned to England, he attended and graduated from the University of Kent at Canterbury with a degree in English and American Literature.

Wilkinson first became active in film and television in the mid-1970s, but did not become familiar to an international audience until 1997. That was when he starred as one of six unemployed workers who strip for cash in Best Picture nominee The Full Monty (1997), and went on to win a BAFTA for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. That same year, he was featured in Oscar and Lucinda (1997) and Wilde (1997). Wilkinson was also shown to memorable effect as a theatre financier with acting aspirations in Best Picture winner Shakespeare in Love (1998).

Over the next few years, Wilkinson would become more popular, especially with American audiences, with such roles as General Cornwallis alongside Mel Gibson in the blockbuster The Patriot (2000) and as the grief-stricken father, Matt Fowler, in the critically acclaimed Best Picture nominee In the Bedroom (2001). For his role in that movie, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

Since then, Wilkinson has made memorable appearances in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Batman Begins (2005), The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), Valkyrie (2008), Duplicity (2009), The Ghost Writer (2010), The Debt (2010) and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), among others. Wilkinson also received his second Academy Award nomination for his acclaimed role in Michael Clayton (2007).

Wilkinson won an Emmy Award for his work as Benjamin Franklin in HBO's John Adams (2008) mini-series. The same year, he received an Emmy nomination for his role in HBO movie Recount (2008), and has also received Emmy nominations for Normal (2003) and The Kennedys (2011).

Wilkinson had two children, Alice and Molly, with his wife Diana Hardcastle.

Michel Gondry

  </p>


  
  <p style="padding:6px;height:250px;color: white;"align = "center">

Born
May 8, 1963 路 Versailles, Seine-et-Oise , now Yvelines, France

He grew up in Versailles with a family who was very 
influenced by pop music. When he was young, Gondry
 wanted to be a painter or an inventor. In the 80s he
  entered in an art school in Paris where he could 
  develop his graphic skills and where he also met 
  friends with whom he created a pop-rock band 
  called Oui-Oui. The band released 2 albums 
  ('Chacun tout le monde' and 'Formidable')
   and several singles until their separation
    in 1992. Gondry was the drummer of the band
	 and also directed their video clips in which 
	 it was possible to see his strange world, 
	 influenced by the 60s and by his childhood. 
	 One of his videos was shown on MTV and when
	  Bj枚rk saw it, she asked him to make her
	   first solo video for 'Human Behaviour'.
	    The partnership is famous: Gondry 
		directed five other Bj枚rk's videos, 
		benefiting by the huge budgets. 
		This led to commissions for other 
		artists around the world, including
		Massive Attack. He also made a lot of commercials for Gap, Smirnoff, Air France, Nike,
         Coca Cola, Adidas, Polaroid and Levi - the latter making him the most highly-awarded director
          for a one-off commercial.

Hollywood became interested in Gondry's success and he directed his first feature movie Human Nature
 (2001), adapting a Charlie Kaufman's scenario, which was shown in the 2001 Cannes Festival. Although
  it wasn't a big success, this film allowed him to direct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)
  , for which he again collaborated with Charlie Kaufman. The movie became a popular independent film
  and he and his co-writers won an Oscar for it.
