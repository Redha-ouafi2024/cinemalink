Scarlett Ingrid Johansson

  </p>

  
 
  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">


Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984 in Manhattan, New York City, New York.
 Her mother, Melanie Sloan is from a Jewish family from the Bronx and her father, Karsten Johansson
  is a Danish-born architect from Copenhagen. She has a sister, Vanessa Johansson,
   who is also an actress, a brother, Adrian, a twin brother, Hunter Johansson, born three minutes
    after her, and a paternal half-brother, Christian. Her grandfather was writer Ejner Johansson.

Johansson began acting during childhood, after her mother started taking her to auditions.
She made her professional acting debut at the age of eight in the off-Broadway production of
"Sophistry" with Ethan Hawke, at New York's Playwrights Horizons. She would audition for commercials
but took rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts. She made her
film debut at the age of nine, as John Ritter's character's daughter in the fantasy comedy
North (1994). Following minor roles in Just Cause (1995), as the daughter of Sean Connery
and Kate Capshaw's character, and If Lucy Fell (1996), she played the role of Amanda in Manny
& Lo (1996). Her performance in Manny & Lo garnered a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award
for Best Lead Female, and positive reviews, one noting, "[the film] grows on you, largely because
of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson", while San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle commentated
 on her "peaceful aura", and wrote, "If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed,
 she could become an important actress."

After appearing in minor roles in Fall (1997) and Home Alone 3 (1997), Johansson garnered widely
 spread attention for her performance in The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford,
  where she played Grace MacLean, a teenager traumatized by a riding accident. She received a
  nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress for the film.
  In 1999, she appeared in My Brother the Pig (1999) and in the music video for Mandy Moore's single,
   "Candy". Although the film was not a box office success, she received praise for her breakout role
    in Ghost World (2001), credited with "sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age". She was also
    featured in the Coen Brothers' dark drama The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), opposite Billy Bob
    Thornton and Frances McDormand. She appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002)
     with David Arquette and Kari Wuhrer.

In 2003, she was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for drama (Girl with a Pearl Earring
(2003)
 and one for comedy (Lost in Translation (2003)
 , her breakout role, starring opposite Bill Murray, and receiving rave reviews and a Best Actress
  Award at the Venice Film Festival. Her film roles include the critically acclaimed Weitz brothers'
   film In Good Company (2004), as well as starring opposite John Travolta in A Love Song for Bobby
    Long (2004), which garnered her a third Golden Globe Award nomination.

She dropped out of Mission: Impossible III (2006) due to scheduling conflicts. Her next film role was
in The Island (2005) alongside Ewan McGregor which earned weak reviews from U.S. critics. After this,
 she appeared in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005) and was nominated again for a Golden Globe Award.
 In May 2008, she released her album "Anywhere I Lay My Head", a collection of Tom Waits covers
 featuring one original song. Also that year, she starred in Frank Miller's The Spirit (2008),
 the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), and played Mary Boleyn opposite Natalie
  Portman in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008).

Since then, she has appeared as part of an ensemble cast in the romantic comedy He's Just Not That
Into You (2009), the action superhero film Iron Man 2 (2010), the comedy-drama We Bought a Zoo (2011)
 and starred as the original scream queen, Janet Leigh, in Hitchcock (2012). She then played her
  character, Black Widow, in the blockbuster action films The Avengers (2012), Captain America:
  The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016),
  Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019) and Black Widow (2021), and also headlined
   the sci-fi action thriller Lucy (2014), a box office success. With more than a decade of work
   already under her belt, Scarlett has proven to be one of Hollywood's most talented young actresses.
    Her other starring roles are in the sci-fi action thriller Ghost in the Shell (2017) and the dark
     comedy Rough Night (2017).

Morgan Freeman

  </p>

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">

With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.

Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.

Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.

His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), and The Power of One (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Unforgiven (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.

More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Se7en (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Chain Reaction (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Kiss the Girls (1997).

Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Along Came a Spider (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama The Sum of All Fears (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy The Big Bounce (2004).

2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.

Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Almighty (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit The Bucket List (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008).

In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.

Recently, Freeman appeared in RED (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan the Barbarian (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.

Luc Besson

  <p style="padding:6px;height:auto;color: white;"align = "center">
  
Born
March 18, 1959 路 Paris, France <br>
 
Luc Besson spent the first years of his life following his parents, scuba diving instructors,
 around the world. His early life was entirely aquatic. He already showed amazing creativity as
 a youth, writing early drafts of Le grand bleu (1988) and Le cinqui猫me 茅l茅ment (1997),
  as an adolescent bored in school. He planned on becoming a marine biologist specializing in
  dolphins until a diving accident at age 17 which rendered him unable to dive any longer.
  He moved back to Paris, where he was born, and only at age 18 did he first have an urban
   life or television. He realized that film was a medium which he could combine all his
   interests in various arts together, so he began taking odd jobs on various films.
    He moved to America for three years, then returned to France and formed Les Films de Loups -
    his own production company, which later changed its name to Les Films de Dauphins. He is now
    able to dive again.
