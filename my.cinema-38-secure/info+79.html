Aaron Taylor-Johnson

  </p>

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">

Aaron Taylor-Johnson is an English stage, television, and film actor.

He was born Aaron Perry Johnson in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, to Sarah and Robert Johnson, a civil engineer. He has a sister, Gemma Johnson, who had a small role in his movie Tom & Thomas (2002). Aaron is of English-Russian Jewish descent.

He began performing at age six, appearing in plays like Macbeth and All My Sons. He worked frequently on television as a young actor, having roles in the TV films San Giovanni: L'Apocalisse (2002), Behind Closed Doors (2003), The Best Man (2006), and Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars (2007), and series The Bill (1984), Family Business (2003), Feather Boy (2004), Casualty (1986), Talk to Me (2007), and Nearly Famous (2007). He made his feature debut in the British film Tom & Thomas (2002), where he played the dual title roles. His first American film was the sequel Shanghai Knights (2003), playing a child version of Charles Chaplin, and his early film credits also include Dead Cool (2004), The Thief Lord (2006), and The Illusionist (2006), where he played a young version of Edward Norton's character Eisenheim.

Aaron became known in England after playing a leading role in the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging (2008), opposite Georgia Groome. He then co-starred with Carey Mulligan in the American drama The Greatest (2009), played John Lennon in the biography Nowhere Boy (2009), and had the lead role of a teenage would-be superhero, Dave Lizewski, in the action superhero riff Kick-Ass (2010), which introduced him to a wide American audience.

After appearing in the thriller Chatroom (2010), Aaron had a large part in the Irish-set drama Albert Nobbs (2011), and co-starred with Taylor Kitsch and Blake Lively in Oliver Stone's California-based action-thriller Savages (2012). Also in 2012, he played Keira Knightley's character's forbidden love interest, Count Vronsky, in the adaptation Anna Karenina (2012), set in Russia.

After reprising his role in the sequel Kick-Ass 2 (2013), Aaron had starring roles in his two biggest films to date, the blockbusters Godzilla (2014), as soldier Ford Brody, and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), as Pietro Maximoff (known as Quicksilver in the Marvel comic books). He first played Pietro in a mid-credits scene in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014).

  </p>

  <p class="text-content" alt="text"style="background-color:rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.6);">

Sally Cecilia Hawkins was born in 1976 in Lewisham hospital, London, England, to Jacqui and Colin Hawkins, authors and illustrators of children's books. She is of English and Irish descent. Hawkins was brought up in Greenwich, in southeast London. She attended James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1998. Hawkins' theatre appearances include Much Ado About Nothing (2000), A Midsummer Night's Dream (2000), Misconceptions (2001), Country Music (2004), and David Hare's adaptation of Federico Garc铆a Lorca's play The House of Bernarda Alba in 2005. Hawkins made her first notable screen performance as Samantha in the 2002 Mike Leigh film All or Nothing (2002). She also appeared as Slasher in the 2004 film Layer Cake (2004). She played the role of Zena Blake in the BBC adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel, Tipping the Velvet (2002) in 2002. Her first major television role came in 2005, when she played Susan Trinder in the BAFTA-nominated BBC drama Fingersmith (2005), an adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel of the same name, in which she co-starred with Imelda Staunton, as she had in Vera Drake (2004). Since then she has gone on to star in another BBC adaptation, Patrick Hamilton's Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. Hawkins appeared in three episodes of the BBC comedy series Little Britain (2003), in addition to Ed Reardon's Week on BBC Radio 4. She has also contributed to the BBC Radio 4 series Concrete Cow.

Gareth Edwards

  </p>

Born
June 1, 1975 路 Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, UK <br>

Gareth James Edwards was born on June 1, 1975 in the English town of Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Growing up, he admired movies such as the 1977 classic "Star Wars", and went on to pursue a film career. He even cites George Lucas and Steven Spielberg as his biggest influences. Edwards studied BA (Hons) Film & Video at the University for the Creative Arts in Farnham (formerly the Surrey Institute of Art & Design), graduating in 1996. In 2012, he received an honorary Master of Arts from UCA.

Edwards got his start in special visual effects, working on visual f/x for programs that aired on networks such as PBS, BBC and the Discovery Channel. In 2008 he entered (and won) the Sci-Fi-London 48-hour film challenge, where a movie had to be created from start-to-finish in just two days, within certain criteria. Edwards wrote and directed his first full-length feature, "Monsters", which was shot in only three weeks. Edwards personally created the film's special effects by using off-the-shelf equipment. Asides from the two main actors (real-life couple Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able), the crew consisted of just five people. The $500,000 thriller received a riotous reception at the South by Southwest festival, and was released by Veritgo Films to great success.

The success of "Monsters" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic "Gojira". Produced by Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, "Godzilla" began development in 2011 with Edwards at the helm, and was released on May 16, 2014 to mixed reviews and tremendous box office success, grossing $529 million worldwide against a $160 million budget.

Following the success of "Godzilla", producer Kathleen Kennedy tapped Edwards to helm a spin-off of "Star Wars" for Lucasfilm Limited. In 2015, it was revealed that Edwards' "Star Wars" spin-off, written Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, would be titled "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story", set for release on December 16, 2016. The film boasts an ensemble cast including Felicity Jones, Donnie Yen, Mad Mikkelsen and James Earl Jones among others.
